##GitLove

###Description:

GitLove is a dating application gearing specifically towards developers. Developers are required to log in to the app by filling out a form with some basic information including their Github username in order to verify that they are, in fact, a developer as well as their developer's level in order to have the option to be matched with a developer that is in the same or similar level. Developer's level ranges from junior to senior. Once logged in, users can browse developers in the home page and have the option to view additional details by clicking on that user. Once they view the users profile users then have the option to comment on that developers profile. If the developer that has been commented on decides that they would like to continue the conversation with that developer, GitLove will check if the users "interested in" and "gender" are a match. If they are, both users will then be able to view each others profiles under the "Match" tab. Users also have the option to view their own profile information and edit it by navigating to their own "Profile" tab and clicking the "edit" button. They can then submit those changes and their profile will be updated automatically. Users also have the option to logout from every page of the application and then immidiatly have the option to log back in with ease.
