#####Not just for desperate losers! 

##Description:


GitLove is a dating application geared specifically towards developers seeking for relationship with another developer. Users are required to log in to the app by filling out a form with some basic information including their Github username in order to verify that they are, in fact, a developer as well as their developer's level in order to have the option to be matched with a developer that is in the same or similar level. Developer's level ranges from junior to senior.   

Once logged in, users can browse developers in the home page and have the option to view additional details by clicking on that user. Once they view the users profile, users then have the option to comment on that developers profile. If the developer that has been commented on decides that they would like to continue the conversation with that developer, GitLove will check if the users "seeking" attributes matches the other user's "gender". If they are a match, both users will then be able to view each others profiles under their "Match" tab.  

Users also have the option to view their own profile information and edit it by navigating to edit their own "Profile" tab and clicking the "edit" button. They can then submit those changes and their profile will be updated automatically. Users also have the option to logout from every page of the application and then immidiatly have the option to log back in with ease. When users comment, they have the option to delete or edit posts. Gitlove is a fun and safe way to meet your perfect developer match! Happy matching :)

3. Date and time displayed on comments as well as a profile pic
4. A "like" tab with the ability to like other users and which will be used in the matching algorithm
5. Clickable profile pics instead of names
